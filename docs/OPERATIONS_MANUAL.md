# 🛠️ TruthBounty Profiling Operations Manual

## Operator Workflow

This manual outlines standard operating procedures for backend performance monitoring, interpreting flame graphs, investigating latency spikes, and detecting regressions during releases.

---

## 1. Daily Health & Performance Inspection

1. Open the Profiling Dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/profiler/dashboard`.
2. Inspect the **Average Latency**, **p95 Latency**, and **p99 Latency** cards.
3. Check the **Slowest Endpoints** table to identify endpoints exceeding SLA targets (> 200ms).
4. Review the **Database Query Bottlenecks** table for queries taking longer than 100ms.

## 2. Investigating Latency Spikes with Flame Graphs

When an endpoint experiences elevated latency:

1. Fetch recent slow traces for the endpoint:
   ```bash
   GET /profiler/traces?route=/claims&minDurationMs=200
   ```
2. Retrieve the trace ID from the response.
3. Fetch the flame graph structure:
   ```bash
   GET /profiler/traces/{traceId}/flamegraph
   ```
4. Examine `value` and `percentage` fields of child nodes to isolate whether time is spent in:
   - Database queries (`category: "db"`)
   - Redis operations (`category: "redis"`)
   - External RPC calls (`category: "blockchain"`)
   - Webhook delivery (`category: "notification"`)

## 3. Deployment Baseline & Regression Testing

Before releasing a new backend version:

1. Take a baseline snapshot of the current release:
   ```bash
   POST /profiler/snapshots
   Body: { "name": "release-v1.4.0-baseline" }
   ```
2. Deploy the target release candidate to staging/production.
3. Run performance test load or allow production traffic to collect traces.
4. Take a target snapshot:
   ```bash
   POST /profiler/snapshots
   Body: { "name": "release-v1.5.0-candidate" }
   ```
5. Execute automated regression detection:
   ```bash
   GET /profiler/regressions?baselineId={baselineId}&targetId={targetId}&thresholdPercent=20
   ```
6. If `status` is `"regressions_detected"`, review the `regressions` array for components with >20% latency degradation.

## 4. Tuning Production Sampling Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Recommended Environment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `always-sample` (fixed-rate 1.0) | Captures 100% of request traces | Local Development, Staging |
| `fixed-rate` (0.05 – 0.20) | Captures fixed percentage of requests | Production (low-to-medium traffic) |
| `adaptive` | Dynamically throttles sampling if CPU exceeds 80% | Production (high traffic / auto-scaling) |
| `header-based` | Samples on-demand via HTTP header `x-profile-request: true` | Production Debugging |

## 5. Handling Replaced Blocks and Removed Logs

The V2 indexer records block hashes and removed logs in PostgreSQL. A block hash mismatch stops the cursor transaction before any projection is written; operators must not manually edit projections or advance the cursor.

1. Confirm the RPC endpoint is serving the configured Optimism chain and finalized/safe data.
2. Inspect `v2_indexer_blocks` for rows with `status = 'replaced'` and `v2_removed_logs` for the affected transaction and log index.
3. After the canonical RPC view is healthy, replay from the last known safe block using the indexer backfill operation.
4. Verify the replacement block hash and projection version advance monotonically before resuming delivery.
